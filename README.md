# Phonebook-
The project is named “Phone Directory”. it is based on the idea of a 
contact app in your mobile phone. this project includes inserting, deleting, 
searching and updating details of a person on runtime using doubly linked 
list. it consists of operations as follows:
 Adding a contact –
 Adding a contacts detail like Name, Phone 
number, Email ID. Also, you can add contacts as many as 
you want. The data will be stored using a doubly linked list. 
 Deleting a contact –
 Deleting a contact by Name. this operation will delete 
the node which contains the details of the contact from the 
doubly linked list.
 Updating a contact-
 Updating a contact includes three options as follows-
 Update name.
 Update Number.
 Update Email ID.
 Searching a contact-
 Searching a contact includes three options as follows-
 Search by name.
 Search by Number.

This project is written in C++ programming language. In order to do the 
operations, I have implemented Doubly Linked List in this project.
Worst-case time complexity of operations are as follows:
 Adding a contact – O (1)
 Searching a contact – O(n)
 Deleting a contact- O(n)
 Updating a contact- O(n)
 Printing the Phonebook- O(n)
